What is GNN?/Why GNN?
From my understanding, Graph Neural Network is a generalized version of a Convolutional Neural Network. 
In CNN, it accepts Euclidean space data; like images, it assumes each central pixel is highly correlated with its adjacent pixels, and each pixel has a fixed number of neighbours. So we apply a fixed size filter to scan the image to find the spatial dependencies of a local area. 
However, what if our input is non-Euclidean space data? In reality, there are lots of these kinds of data, like network topology, knowledge graph, etc. In this case, GNN is utilized. So GNN is designed to learn the spatial dependency for non-Euclidean space data. It's not much fit to our problem because it's time-series data. We did data preprocessing to make our data fit into the GNN model, and our ideas were inspired by a paper published in 2021. The authors utilized a graph neural network to classify human activities collected only from smartphone sensors. But our ideas are not exactly the same as the paper proposed. 
So in our problem, we have time sequence data in 128 time steps. Each time step has a feature vector with 9 features collected from the gyroscope and accelerometer. We first calculated the mean of the 9 features in each time step, and we considered each mean in each time step as a node. After this, we sequentially connect nodes in each time step and form a line graph. So in the graph, there are 128 nodes and 127 edges. Each node has a single feature, the mean of the 9 features collected from sensors in that timestep. Finally, we feed the graph into a graph neural network to do the graph classification.
